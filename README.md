# Color Psychology

- Color psychology is the science of how color affects human behavior.

# Why does it matter?

- In a peer reviewed journal article, Satyendra Singh determined that it takes a mere 90 seconds for a customer to form an opinion about a product. And, 62-90% of that interaction is determined by the color of the product alone.

- The color schemes we choose have the potential to evoke emotions from the user that they then associate with your product. Color can also be used to influence the user's behavior.

# Blue

- Blue calls to mind feelings of calmness, serenity and trustworthiness. It often is described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly.
- Not a challenging color because it's common in everyday life. Clear blue skies, calm waters.
- Companies use this to cultivate a user's trust.

# Green

- Neutral color and one we experience everyday, grass and trees.
- Green is strongly associated with nature and subsequently has lots of positive associations.
- It can give users feelings of calm, rejuvenation, affluence and optimism.
- Darker shades are more linked to money, so sites that want to suggest affluence, growth and stability often use those shades.

# "Ugly" Colors

- Some of the best call to action colors are the “ugly” ones — orange and yellow.
- “Psychologically, the ‘anti-aesthetic’ colors may well capture more attention than those on the aesthetically-correct list.”
- Since the goal is to capture attention, then you may do just fine with that big orange button (BOB). Or yellow.)

# White

- Most well-designed websites today use plenty of white space in order to create a sense of freedom, spaciousness, and breathability.
- Dieter Rams "Good Design Is as Little Design as Possible"
- Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.
-  A lot of elements, images, colors and different shapes in a page can make your site look more like an infomercial and cause your readers leave because they’re uncomfortable.
