Introductory presentation to the concept of Color Psychology

# Color Psychology

- Color psychology is the science of how color affects human behavior.

---
# Why does it matter?

- In a peer reviewed journal article, Satyendra Singh determined that it takes a mere 90 seconds for a customer to form an opinion about a product. And, 62-90% of that interaction is determined by the color of the product alone.

- The color schemes we choose have the potential to both evoke emotions from the user that they then associate with your product and to influence the user's behavior.

---
# Blue

- Blue calls to mind feelings of calmness, serenity and trustworthiness. It often is described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly.
- Not a challenging color because it's common in everyday life. Clear blue skies, calm waters.
- Companies use this to cultivate a user's trust.

# Examples

- Facebook
- PayPal
- Many Banks

# Caveat

- Should not be used with anything related to food.
- Studies have shown that the color blue actually supresses the appetite.
- Blue food are not common in nature.
- Evolutionary theory suggests that blue is a color associated with poison.

# Orange

- Fun, stimulating color that helps to “stimulate physical activity, competition, and confidence.”
- The color alo suggests urgency.
- Used to motivate the user to take action (BUY!, DONATE!, SIGN-UP!)

---

# Caveat

- Orange can be slightly overwhelming.
- Use sparingly to bring attention to something (Amazon.com)

- Can be interpreted as cheap (BigLots.com)
- Not recommended if you are trying to convey a sense of luxury.

---

# Black

- Elegance. Sophistication. Power.
- If you are selling high-value luxury consumer items on your website, black probably would be a good choice.

# Examples:

- Mercedes
- Lamborghini
_ Louis Vuitton

# Green

- Neutral color and one we experience everyday, grass and trees.
- Green is strongly associated with nature and subsequently has lots of positive associations.
- It can give users feelings of calm, rejuvenation, affluence and optimism.
- Darker shades are more linked to money, so sites that want to suggest affluence, growth and stability often use those shades.

# Examples:

- Greenpeace.com
- M & T Bank
- Whole Foods

# Call to Action Colors

- In strict testing environments, the highest-converting colors for calls to action are bright primary and secondary colors – red, green, orange, yellow.
- Darker colors like black, dark gray, brown, or purple have very low conversion rates.

# Isolation Effect

- States that you remember things better if they stand out.
- Amazon's "Add to Cart" button.
- Movember "Donate" button.

# "Ugly" Colors

- Some of the best call to action colors are the “ugly” ones — orange and yellow.
- “Psychologically, the ‘anti-aesthetic’ colors may well capture more attention than those on the aesthetically-correct list.”
- Since the goal is to capture attention, then you may do just fine with that big orange button (BOB). Or yellow. (Amnesty International)

# White

- Most well-designed websites today use plenty of white space in order to create a sense of freedom, spaciousness, and breathability.
- Dieter Rams "Good Design Is as Little Design as Possible"
- Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.
-  A lot of elements, images, colors and different shapes in a page can make your site look more like an infomercial and cause your readers leave because they’re uncomfortable.
